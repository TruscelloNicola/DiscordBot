# README FOR API DISCORD BOT

### This project requires .NET 8 SDK to work.

### APIIntegratedBot is the project to be tested, Old is there only for archiving our previous work.


## How do I test this?
The UI and Discord bot with API can be executed separately, but if tested together, execute the bot with API first, before executing the UI Blazor app.

## The UI is not showing anything and the console(s) are empty.
If the UI is empty and the consoles of the respective projects are not displaying anything, then a restart of the debug is required. The bot has not initialized.

## The ecosystem doesn't work when using Firefox.
Due to Firefox' security measures it is not plausible to debug this ecosystem in it. Please use Google Chrome or another browser with non-impeding localhost restrictions.
